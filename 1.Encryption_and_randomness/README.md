# Week 1: Encryption and randomness

This weekâ€™s exercises focus on classical ciphers and randomness.

Theory of the exercises are based mainly on the book [Serious Cryptography](https://nostarch.com/seriouscrypto). It is available in the library of the University of Oulu in [digital format](https://oula.finna.fi/Record/oy_electronic_oy.9917612964306252).

*Pages 1-38* are relevant for this exercise and might be good to read beforehand.

## Environment

You should have access to the Linux/Unix environment to be able to complete Task 3.

The course virtual machine is suitable.

## Grading

You are eligible for the following points from the exercise. Previous task(s) should be completed before going further.

Task #|Grade|Description|
-----|:---:|-----------|
Task 1 | 1 | Fooling a perfect cipher
Task 2 | 2 | Vigenere cipher
Task 3 | 3-4 | Generating randomness and testing randomness


## Task 1: Fooling a perfect cipher

Recall that the one-time pad provides perfect secrecy, i.e., there is nothing an adversary can learn from the cipher text even given unlimited computational resources. 

However, the perfect cipher provides no other guarantees and does not provide authentication.

You are given the following encryption of an ASCII encoded message: "Hi Kimmo". Each row in the table represents one character in binary and hexadecimal format. This task expects that the original form of the one-time pad has been used with bitwise exclusive OR.

Note: ASCII is presented in 7-bit format, so we must have 8-bit key(s) here!

Binary | Hex
--|--
0b01101001 | 0x69
0b00010101 | 0x15
0b01011111 | 0x5f
0b01001110 | 0x4e
0b00100000 | 0x20
0b00011100 | 0x1c
0b10101101 | 0xad
0b01100001 | 0x61


**Task 1.1** Produce a ciphertext that will decode into "No Rauli" under the same secret one-time pad as the original ciphertext was produced.

**Task 1.2** Produce a ciphertext that will decode into a 8 character ASCII string of your choice. Can you produce longer ciphertexts than 8 characters? Why/why not?

**Task 1.3** What is the secret one-time pad in binary format (8 x 8 bit)? How malleability applies on a one-time pad?

> You should return possible source code for how you solved the secret and produced the new ciphertexts. Answer the questions and **also** explain briefly the idea of your method.

Obviously we are not going to give you the correct key to check your answer, but here is a bit more cryptographic way. This might be applied in the future as well. You can verify that your key is correct, by combining single hexadecimal string from binary values, and calculating sha256 hash for the final string with `openssl` on Linux, for example if we combine a given encrypted message:

```shell
 echo -n "0x69155f4e201cad61" | openssl dgst -sha256
```

Note `0x` prefix in the string and lowercase format. `-n` flag prevents appending a new line in the end. Possible leading zeros in hex values are included. UTF-8 encoding has been used. Everything matters!

Correct hash for the key is `0de7672884e0d76c02387ef14360770ec923fd34f87d3303d082ec2da7a8741e`

> **EXTRA:** If you know Finnish, we have an additional and complete tutorial available about this task in [here.](https://shakinguptech.ouspg.org/harjoitus1/)

## Task 2: Vigenere cipher

The following text is an English text that has been encrypted by using an unknown key with a Vigenere cipher. All punctuation and whitespaces have been removed from the text before encryption.

**Task 2.1** Decrypt the text. What is the secret key? How many permutations were used? The course book can be very helpful.

**Task 2.2** Where is the text from? Who wrote it? If you find the source, read the whole text/article/newsitem/book...


> Show your work (code and reasoning; how did you decrypt this?) and answer the questions. You should not use existing tools which can solve this quite quickly. However, if you did, mention these tools, the commands you used **and** make a step-by-step report **why Vigenere cipher was decryptable**. 

## Task 3: Generating randomness

<p align="right">
<img src="img/random.png" alt="Random number. Source: XKCD="100px" align="right"/>
</p>

Randomness has a critical role in most of the cases to achieve *semantic security.* However, there is a difference between randomness and predictability as seen from the XKCD picture on the right; both should be noted.

There are many available tools and methods to generate randomness, but are they truly cryptographically unpredictable?

Some available software methods which **might or might not be** cryptographically unpredictable:

  * Python's programming language `random` library
  * C language's `rand` and `drand48`
  * `Math.random()` in JavaScript
  * `java.util.Random` in Java
  * Devices `/dev/urandom` and `/dev/random` on *nix systems
  * Bash function `$RANDOM`
  * [BCryptGenRandom](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/bcrypt/nf-bcrypt-bcryptgenrandom) on Windows. (legacy CryptGenRandom is **deprecated.**)
  * System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator on [C# .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.randomnumbergenerator?view=net-5.0) on Windows
  * [Get-Random](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-random?view=powershell-7.1) on PowerShell
  * `openssl rand` method
  * Kernel syscall [getrandom](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/1df27313f50a57497c1faeb6a6ae4ca939c85a7d/include/linux/syscalls.h#L1001)

**Additional details about Microsoft API:s**

Using new [CNG API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccng/cng-portal) is recommended. All PRNG functions derive the same NIST standardized [method](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/bcrypt/nf-bcrypt-bcryptgenrandom). More details below.
  * [.NET cryptography model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/cryptography-model)
  * [Cross-Platform Cryptography in .NET Core and .NET 5](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/cross-platform-cryptography)

**Task 3.1** What is the difference between `/dev/urandom` and `/dev/random` devices? Note also the recent changes on Kernel.

**Task 3.2** Generate randomness into different files using different methods that you have access to or manually (dice, smashing keyboard maybe?) You are not limited to a given list from above. **Use at least four** different methods. For non-manual methods, generate at least 1 megabyte of randomness.

**Task 3.3** Analyse those files with [dieharder](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dieharder). Report your findings. However, *it is recommended to use generators (e.g. /dev/urandom) directly if possible instead of previously generated files!* Otherwise, we might not have enough data to evaluate them properly. You can also use some alternative tools instead such as [gjrand](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gjrand/) or [pracrand](http://pracrand.sourceforge.net/) which are considered being more accurate even though dieharder is more popular tool. (Tool hosted on SourceForge != tool is bad)!

To analyse manual methods, you might need to use the ASCII formatted presentation. ( Take a look at `man dieharder`)

**Answer at least for the following questions:**

 What is the meaning of p-value and null hypothesis in this context? Can you describe why tests are passed/not passed? Which methods seem to provide randomness with high entropy? If you have been using generic software libraries, results might not be good and can be very similar. What could be the reason?

For Arch based Linux, you can install dieharder as :
```shell
yay -Sy dieharder
```

For Debian based Linux, you can install dieharder as :
```shell
apt-get update && apt-get install dieharder
```


More theoretical manual of dieharder can be found [here.](https://rurban.github.io/dieharder/manual/dieharder.pdf)

**Task 3.4** Which methods from the given list are considered as cryptographically unpredictable? Why?

*It should be noted that it is possible to design a cryptographically
weak PRNG that will fool any statistical test e.g. dieharder, therefore it cannot be fully trusted as measurement of security.*

> Include all commands and possible source code(s) in your report. Answer the questions and clarify your findings.

> To acquire full points from this task, you are expected to deeply reflect on things; are we even able to review this task equally, since there is randomness included? Note also, that we are analysing files instead of generators.
